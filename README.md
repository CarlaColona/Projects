# WELCOME TO MY REPOSITORY PROJECTS 
Hello!
I am Carla, student of Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. Here you can find projects and ideas that I developed over time.
The keyword of my works is: hybridization. The combination of humanistic studies and new technologies taught me how to establish a relationship between two worlds which are not so distant as we believe. From communication strategies to storytelling, from art digitalisation to knowledge extraction and representation in my projects I create a dialogue between past and present, old and new, classicism and innovation.
